"{\n  \"text\": \" Okay, who wants to talk about cordless rear handle saws? I do. Actually, it took a while to round up. I had to borrow some saws from some people, but tell me you have a problem having too many saws without telling me that you have a problem owning too many saws. Okay, so let's go through this. This is every rear handle cordless saw that is currently on the market, with one notable exception. I do not have with me the 7 1/4 inch skill saw. This is a 10 1/4 inch, I don't have the 7 1/4 inch. It's basically the same saw, just a smaller upper and lower guard, and a smaller blade. This thing is a beast. I'm going to probably hurt myself. Okay, so background. Why do we use rear handle saws? Namely, that's a saw with a handle on the rear. Here on the west coast, I think primarily west of the Mississippi, we've always just used skill saw, a worm drive saw. Blade is on the left, most of us are right-handed users. We want to be able to see the blade, and we want to be able to push the saw. We don't want to have our wrist at the top, and none of this stuff looking at the blade on the other side. It's just the way that we've done it, that's the way we prefer it here on the west. So, let's go through this. Most of you probably used a skill saw in the past, if you use this style. That was a worm drive saw that weighed about 15 pounds. I remember when we finally got a Mag back in the mid-90s, like the Mag 77, and it was a pound lighter. We loved it. And then I think I reviewed for JLC back in 2014, there was like a Mag 77 LT that was primarily designed as women came into the trades, and it was still lighter yet. That was my favorite saw. I loved it. Right up until Makita released this 36 volt saw, back in I think 2017, we immediately got one for review and promptly bought another. That has been our favorite saw ever since. By the way, you can read the review of almost all of these saws in the link below in the Journal of Light construction. Since that was posted two years ago, the Metabo HPT just came out, and of course the Makita XGT, which is kind of their new platform for bigger tools and more power. Okay, so let me just do a very quick breakdown. You can read all the specs online. I don't want to waste your time. Milwaukee with a 12 amp hour battery, saw hook. All of these saws have blade breaks, and they all bevel to about 53 degrees, 5, 3, 53 degrees. So there it is. Onboard blade wrench. Yeah, just all the standard stuff. Here is the DeWalt. Same thing, Raptor hook. I really like the bevel gauge on the DeWalt. Always have. Then here's the new XGT. Right? So you see a theme? Some of the hooks will go over a 2.5 inch. I enjoy some don't. Again, you can read the specs online. The green Metabo hook on the top. Truthfully, I prefer the hook on the side. It can be a little awkward putting it on top. Who cares? I'm just glad it's got a hook. And of course, the Makita 36 volt. Same thing. This is my favorite placement. You can actually hang this on a 3.5 inch beam. Not that great. 2.5 it works really well. And then last, but not least, is the Hilti. Plastic hook. Seems a little cheap. Pretty lightweight saw. Again, bevels to 53 degrees. And just for giggles, the Makita XGT 10.25 inch beam cutting saw. I love this thing. And if you're currently taking the anabolic, this bad boy. Oh man, what a ridiculous saw. Look at the size of this battery. There's the hook. Okay. Let me go in order. Here are the weights. The skill saw is 18.6 pounds. Yeah, 18.6 pounds. This guy here, 14.2. So it's even lighter than the skill saws that we used to use. 14.2, the Milwaukee, 12.4 pounds. No, 13.4. The Milwaukee is 13.4 pounds. The DeWalt is 13.8. The XGT, 11.8. The Metabo, 10.6. Yeah, it feels like you're picking it up without a battery, but there's a battery in it. The Makita that I absolutely love and have used for the last four years. Where's that at on my list? 12.4 pounds. So pretty lightweight. This is why I picked it in the review. It adds up. When you're picking up a saw and making repetitive cuts, save the weight. And the Hilti comes in at 12 pounds. Okay, this is just what the saws look like. I'm going to go ahead and make a few cuts with those. I'm going to put on the point of view footage. Because there's a couple of things that I want to point out. First off, the fact that these are all cordless. And honestly, I will take any of these saws with the exception of this guy. That skill is just too heavy. I'll take any of these saws because they don't have cords, even though there's some minor annoyances. So I'm going to set all these down. Let's make some cuts. And then I'll explain to you really what my current favorite saw is and why. Okay, so let's go ahead. I'm going to make a couple of cuts with each saw set at 53 degrees, 5'3\\\". And that's a 45. So notice the sight line and this saw is incredibly powerful. What I don't like about this saw is that the handle is a little too close. So the balance can be a little wonky. But the sight line is pretty good and it has so much power that even a compound miter like this, no problem at all. I think I misstated it. 45 and 45. So good sight line. The bevel gauge is, I don't know, who cares? I really don't care. You can see it's got the little tick marks. There's no stop. I don't care personally. Plenty of power. As you can tell, the saws really aren't getting bogged down. Let's do the healthy. So here's the bevel gauge. No stops. I don't care. 45 degrees. This one's a little smaller sight line. I would prefer it to be bigger personally. But it does have a light. I don't know that you can see it in the daylight. But it does have a light. And we found it in early morning or in the wintertime inside. That was actually pretty helpful. Go one more. Yeah, I know. They're not that parallel. I know. I know. Okay, so this annoys the daylights out of us. Notice how the zero is uphill of the tick mark. Everybody who, so if I want to go to 45, then I have to go 45 that tick mark. Everybody who's tried this saw has been five degrees off the first time they used it. So a little slower. I have to let off just a little bit. Now, here's what I want you to notice. Very small sight line. I don't like that in comparison, but this has been my saw of choice for the last four years. So it doesn't really matter. But just so you can make an informed decision. Again, plenty of power. Okay, so here's the XGT bevel gauge. Same thing. It's uphill. I'm used to it. Doesn't matter to me anymore. I do like this plug. I can definitely push it a little better, a little harder than that 36 volt. But notice very small sight line. Again, who cares? Dust port. Nice strong saw. So stronger than the 36 volt and lighter. Okay, pretty amazing. Take this battery out. So I have a two and a half amp hour, which trust me, it is noticeable. It's pretty weak. Put this back into the big saw. And last, but not least, is the Metabo 36 volt saw. The lightest saw in this batch. Set it to 45. I like that bevel gauge. Easy to see. Very tactile. A little slower. But did you notice right off the bat? Look how big that sight line is. Oh, I love, I really love this saw. Okay, so I can push it pretty hard. That's a two by ten dug for a little bit. No problem. I mean, my goodness. But are we really going to complain about that? And just for giggles, let's go ahead and use these other two saws. These are both 10 and a quarter inch saws. Saw stop there. Nice big 10 inch blade. What a thing of beauty. I'm just going for it. Okay, so there's the, what are we calling this? What was I calling this? Whatever, but there's the view. I'm probably brain. I should have probably eaten lunch. Same thing. This bad boy is all ready for dust collection. It's even got a Bluetooth connection. Sold separate, of course. Pretty amazing. A cordless 10 and a quarter inch saw. All of these saws, by the way, have Diablo blades. That is my blade of choice. Now let's do this guy. It's your classic skill. So Worm Drive saw. Tons of power. Fast. But look at the size of this thing. Great. So notice right off the bat. I really can't see past this. So what I'm actually doing is just trying to make the table parallel to that other line. Is it a deal breaker? No. Honestly, tall guys, you could probably see it better. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Is it a deal breaker? No. Honestly, tall guys, you could probably see it better. There it is. Okay. There it is. Kind of warm. Okay. Now that you've seen some cuts, again, this was just... It's a high level view of the saws. Basically, this is what they look like when they're cutting compound miters for jacks. And here's the weight. Now, what's my personal opinion? Well, let me say this. I don't know that it's possible to declare any one tool the best. It's so subjective. My preferences are completely different than me. I grew up on the West Coast. This is where I learned to cut. East Coast guys, you have a different set of viewpoints and priorities. So I really can't tell you what you should go out and buy. All I can do is explain what I would choose and why I would choose it. And hopefully keep it simple enough that when you watch this review, you're like, this is just a waste of my time. I hope. So what saw would I pick if I was going to go buy a saw right after turning these cameras off? Can you guess which one do you think it is? It should have been obvious. It's Simitavo HBT. I just, I have to say, picking up this saw and using it, it's 10.6 pounds. That is, that is, I can't even... Words clearly fail me. I love this saw. I really like this saw. It's so light. I'm 44. The weight of my tools will play a direct role into how much longer I get to do what it is that I love to do. So I'm going to pick it based on weight alone. I really like the sight line. Metabo batteries are not super expensive. So Kyle and I, we've been working together for 17 years. Is it 17? Goodness. Yeah, February of 2005. Kid was like just 20 years old. Man, we're old now. Anyway, digress. I think I want three of these total. That way if somebody's cutting rafters, they can have one saw in a bevel or cutting rake wall studs. One saw in a bevel, one saw square, and then we still have one out for the second guy to use. And they're super lightweight. So I recommend the Metabo HBT. That's what I would buy. Now here's a caveat to that. Metabo HBT doesn't really have this whole ecosystem of tools that I use. They have a great Recept saw that's cordless. I love the plunge router that's cordless and the triple hammer. Beyond that, I don't have any other Metabo HBT tools. So you'd have to do the research if that was an ecosystem you wanted to get into. Okay. Now maybe you don't want to just have like one Metabo tool and everything else to Walt or Milwaukee or Makita. Totally understand. If it's not this saw, then I would recommend the Makita XGT. This saw is only 11.8 pounds. It's more powerful. There's everything to love about this saw. There's no negatives. I'm really just picking this mostly because it's lighter and I really like the sight line. You'd be so happy with either of these saws. The advantage of this XGT is that Makita is building out this whole XGT lineup with more powerful tools and that might appeal to you. Maybe you need a lot of bigger tools, you know, bigger rotohammers, that kind of thing. Plus, if you have this, then it will share batteries with the 10 and a quarter inch XGT beam saw. This is an amazing saw. It's not the most powerful. It does get bogged down. I couldn't care less. I don't have to roll out a cord. I don't have to roll out a thick gauge cord. I love this saw. So for us, we want two of the 10 and a quarter inch and three of the Metabo's. So there's us. Any major nitpicks about this saw? Nope. It's a good saw. These big 12 amp hour batteries, they make the saw just a little heavier. They last a long time. Milwaukee, in my experience, is a great platform. DeWalt, I'm not a fan. It rips the best. So we have one of these that's dedicated to ripping form panels and, oh, I don't know, like stair treads. It has a ripping guide on it and that's what it's dedicated to. We use it for nothing else. The Hilti, I can't justify the cost. So in the Makita 36 volt, great saw. Find it on sale with batteries thrown in. You're not going to have any regrets. That saw is four years old. Still going great. Okay. Thanks for watching, everybody. I hope I didn't waste your time. I really love framing. It is such a pleasure to be able to get to use a new tool like this.

We don't need a ton of backing up top for drywall, but we do want to add some for the tile person and or trim carpenter across the top of the fireplace.

This is the zip system panel and it is a structural one panel specifically designed  to go vertical and provide just a little bit more stiffness. Actually, the load tables can go up just a little bit with structural one panels. The other thing about this panel is four by eight so we would have to block the panel edge. Remember, we need that consistent edge nailing spacing. I think I probably said that better. It's the edge nail spacing, right? So if we're six inches everywhere, then we have to block that so we're six inches there too. This panel has the green coating is a weather-resistant barrier that is bonded to the OSB panel during manufacturing. So what that means is once it's fastened, we can tape the seams, improve our air tightness numbers, and it is ready for siding. We don't need to put a house wrap over the top of it. This sheet can also go vertically or horizontally and we know that because it has a fastening pattern. This is 16 inches running this way. This is two foot. This is 16 again. And then if we rotate the panel, we could use it horizontally or on the roof and same thing. We have 16 inch, two foot, so on and so forth. Here's what that panel looks. Tico tested. So again, an industry standard for wall sheathing, wall and roof sheathing. One other thing that I want to point out, it says strength axis this way. That does not apply most of the time to wall sheathing. What that applies to is when we use it for a roof or a floor situation, this is true of both of these panels, by the way. The strength axis runs the direction of the long edge, the eight or the nine foot or the ten foot long edge. What that means is that when we step on the panel on the floor, a roof application, it's stiffer in between the supporting members. It doesn't actually relate to lateral applications. And again, I will link to notes in the description below from the manufacturers that clearly state that. Okay, so just a quick recap. We have wind and earthquake forces. Those are our lateral loads. Remember, we're trying to keep our walls to stay in their shape, the house or the structure, to stay in its shape. It could collapse. One way or another, those forces are going to transfer through the building and out into the ground. They can either do that through load paths or they can do it through building collapse. Clearly, we want to avoid building collapse. There's a significant advantage in lightweight wood construction. It's easy to build and because it's lightweight, the forces of an earthquake on a building are directly proportional to the weight of the building. So lighter weight structures see less forces. Additionally, wood can actually absorb and dissipate some of those forces. So it's rigid, yet it's flexible where we need it to be. For us as builders and framers, our job is to make sure that we have the right size sheathing and that we get our edge nailing and our field nailing correct with the correct passoner. When we do all those things according to the engineer, we end up with strong, safe buildings that save lives and often require a whole lot less rework after a significant wind or seismic event. I hope this has been helpful. I'm not an engineer. This is very, very basic. But I think it's just having a very basic understanding as framers. Then we go, okay, so when I'm boundary nailing at the edge of my windows, when I'm nailing into my top plates, when I'm nailing into my bottom plates, when I add my hold downs and I install them correctly, there's not a lot of rocket science to it, consistent craftsmanship, then the occupants of our buildings, they'll be safe.

Tight nailing means minimum 3x6 studs, which aren\u2019t available. We can nail 2 2x6s together but he\u2019d require glue and nails. . . 4x6 20\u2019 cut down to 104 \u215d\u201d studs leaves us with useable waste, is stronger (his preference) and is actually $2 cheaper per than doubling studs.

First of all, we are taking these Roseburg 70 Series iJoyce and running the factory end right into those hangers at the beams and LVLs. We're going to let them all run wild until it's time to cut them to length. Measure back the thickness of your rim plus an eighth. In this case, the rigid rim is inch and a half. So I snapped a line an inch and five eighths because everything always grows. Mark with a big 12 inch speed square. Only the top and bottom flanges you can eyeball right through that cut. Run your saw right down until it stops on the pony wall. Lift up on the joist for those last couple of inches. This is not going to put a radius cut in your joist. If you don't believe me, go ahead and try it yourself. Hey, this kind of sounds like the small print at the end of an insurance commercial. Okay, so there are the 16 foot lengths of the rigid rim. Remember, it has to be nailed six inches on center into the pony wall. One nail on each side of the flange. One nail top and bottom flange on the outside. And there it is.

So that means I can use a gun to nail the hanger in place, lift the beam and then as we set joist, I just hand nail, you want to make sure you use at least that 3 inch nail.

"\n\n{\n  \"text\": \"Okay, welcome back to the channel everybody. What you see in front of you is the basement foundation from last spring. That's right, we are finally ready to start. Well, actually that's not true. We came over to Snap Lines because we knew we were going to start sometime in the next few weeks and we had nice weather with dry walls. So let me run you through what I think is the fastest way to square up a walkout or daylight basement. The secret sauce is the Stabila LA 180 layout station. It shoots square, but not dots. It shoots beams. Now the back of this house is 64 feet long. I can't remember what it is front to back, 35 and change. When I use this laser, I adjust it manually and I get it close. It's actually pretty uncanny. And then with the dial, well, we dial it right in. Okay. So five and six. And I'm just going to go right off. Yeah, that's nice. I just go right for that little indent. Five and six, we can just pull that to the corner and I'll just go like every, I don't know, 10 or so feet, 20 feet, I guess. That is right on the wall. The laser is set to the outside corner of the wall and now we're shooting 64 feet and aligning it with the detector. I'm going five and three eighths in instead of five and a half for two by six. And honestly, our mudsills probably five and five eighths. Five and six. For frankly, no good reason. I just prefer to have the mudsill hang out just a little bit. I don't know why. Since the laser is aligned with the outside of the foundation, obviously the detector is going to pick up the outside of the wall. I'm then going to measure off for the inside of the muscle. Yeah, I know what you mean. Five and six. Now we didn't move anything, right? No. Okay. All right, so we're good? Yeah. Okay, so don't move this. Don't move this. Now we're going to take this. So we've got 64 feet dead straight. Now we want to shoot up all of those steps. Look at that. I should have a... So I'm actually going to mark here this way. That is on the money, dude. I can't believe that. Five and six. That's right on the edge as well. Who did the foundation work, Noah? So five and six. That is like, man, that's like a 16th back. I am impressed. So five and six, five and three eighths. Now we're going to take the world's biggest level and just plum down on each step. Okay. Yeah, I'll just come down, Noah. I mean, it's literally that easy, right? Now we're just connecting the dots and marking the steps at the same time. That guy I've kind of already got. I just eyeball it through to here. Not bad. Okay. So at this point, I think what we want to do is just snap a bunch of lines, Kyle. Like it? All right. Pardon the mess. We didn't get a chance to get over and clean it up. So don't judge us for also a storm came through and blew a bunch of our insulation off. So got a little bit of rework to do. Such is life. Six to one, speed reel. Okay. And I've got this mark. This is good. We'll just be able to plum through. Don't let the chalk line hit the wet slab. It's a quick way to ruin chalk lines, which we will do as soon as we snap lines on the slab. Okay. I'm going to plum up real quick. I think we're fine there. So now I'm just going to, I'm going to do this without looking. And I got to move that to the corner. Did you figure out the methodology? So the laser was set in the foreground, shot 64 feet across the back. We squared up to the right of you as the viewer. Now we're on the opposite side, squaring right back at you, same wall as the reference to square up that far wall. Wrong way. I knew it. I knew it. I even switched halfway through. Okay. So I'm going to come to that Noah. Dude, that is on the money. I was not expecting that. I tell you what, I was so stressed last spring. Five and six. Okay. Let me, okay. I'm going to pull him this down while I'm here. Just cause, wow, I was not expecting. I'll have to tell Tyler that. Yes. I'm genuinely surprised. If you go back to the one, to the Olympic foundations playlist, whatever it was, it was a train wreck. My wife came out, never been out to shoot, or to shoot to poor concrete. Honestly, the spot that she flattened the wall at the top was the best of the whole foundation. Anyway, I just, the front of this thing is a little wonky. I'll talk about that later, at least the step-downs were right on the money. Dude, we're talking like nothing. All right. I'm just going to chuck this to you. I'm going to link it right above, right there. There's how we formed and we placed the concrete. And it just, it was so stressful. People on site that had never done it before, but it was all hands on deck. That was all we had. It was the diagonal eye joist that was connected to all of those steps. I'm standing in a window wall. Yeah, we're going five and six every one. Let me make sure I didn't mess that up over here. And then it kicked off. And then it kicked off into the brambles. Anyway, we're coming back to that. The magic is the laser. Its tolerances are so tight and it is so accurate that we're going to trust it. I mean, obviously go set it up, pull some math, verify for yourself before you use it. Cause yeah, that's kind of a big deal. It is such a good piece of kit. I cannot recommend it highly enough. It is not cheap, well worth it. I'd say go for it. That laser is more accurate than us stretching steel tape measures 64 feet. So set it up and from this perspective, top left corner, shoot square, top right corner, shoot square. And then I'll show you how we do the rest. At that point, because it fans a beam, all we got to do is plum down and connect the dots as you've seen. Simple, simple, simple and fast and really easy to teach. Kyle and Noah had never done this before. That's the whole point of us filming this is so now we have that reference. You don't need the laser anymore then, right? That we can go back to. I'll turn it off. Yeah, it's just great. Before we do the job next door, the guys can just rewatch the video and then we're gonna blow into that, snap it out. We're convinced that we could snap this whole thing out in less than 30 minutes because of that laser. There is no other way to do it that fast than that accurate. Let me go move this. That I know of. But then again, my experience is quite limited. Also run forest, run. You know you're getting old when you cramp your pec, jogging. Yeah, you tell me if you want me to pull it tighter. I'm good right there. Nice. All right. Can you have your guys? They're good. You like it? Yeah. I like it. I like it. I like it. I like it. I like it. Yeah. All right. Okay, yeah, let's stop. So it's very fine, fine adjustment. So I was wait, because it is gonna self level. My dot is at five and three eighths. So let's take the detector. You can take that down. I'm gonna put a mark here. Got to sharpen this. And let's go mark each of the other two steps. That's gonna be our reference point. Okay, so basically step one was laser at the bottom and we shoot square, 64 foot was our reference point. Now we know that this side is square. We've already checked our step down. So we know ironically, honestly, we're not professional concrete guys, but it turned out really good. Then what we did is we put the laser exactly the opposite, use the same reference point and we squared that other side. So technically square and square, right? These two should be parallel, or at least within the tolerance of the laser, which is probably well within our tolerance. Now we're using this reference as a reference point. Let's show Kyle. What Kyle's doing is he's marking just, it doesn't matter what it is, it's just that it's 90 degrees to our side reference point. And then mark on the far side. Just don't step in that giant puddle. Ha ha ha ha. So basically now Kyle has a point on the wall where he's at the wall he just marked and I have a point on the wall that I'm at. Now if we basically just dry line through that, that's a parallel to the back because the side is square to the back. I think it makes sense if I don't belabor the point. Now we can snap all of our front jogs off of these reference points. Okay. Yeah. So just mark five and six, and then basically measure mark to mark. I don't like getting black chalk on my hands because it cracks them. I like smooth hands. Five, eight and an eighth? Okay, 58 and an eighth. Sounds like the wind's in that. So five, eight, 58 and an eighth. That's gonna line up with Kyle's. Okay. Then let's snap that all the way through yours. So I'll come and get the dumb in. Yeah. Okay. Go ahead and snap it. Okay. I'll let this down. Now what we're gonna wanna do is I'm gonna go five and three eighths plus a half. So five and seven eighths so that our sheeting touches these and we don't have to bend those. So off of your snap line, 23 one. Not bad, right on the buck out. Okay. Off the, no, yep, exactly. Yep. Now can you give me the number? Nevermind. Nevermind. I'm being stupid. Okay. You can stop. No, we're gonna reset. Okay. I'm gonna go five and three eighths and use my sweet Martinez square to just line that up. I could pull parallel from the other end, but I'm here. This is easy. Okay. So now I have that. Now, if we come over to Kyle, let me move the, this was your, yeah. Yeah. That's where I got my reference. So here's your reference. That was the laser, right? Dude, I got a sweet peek-a-dry. So this was our laser, right? Yep. That's control. You're sure? Yep. Okay. So then from your five and six, give me that number and I'll go the same here, except I don't wanna, I'm gonna keep it in the half. Okay. I'll have you snap it just cause I'm posing. I'm like George on Seinfeld. Okay. Basically, we're gonna make adjustments later is I'm gonna go five and three eighths and I'm gonna have you mark off of your line or off of your control point over there. Our control point is everything. So from your control, go 35 inches toward the front. Yep. Yeah. So off your control 35. And then I'm gonna take your chalk line. You're gonna stay right where you're at and I'm gonna go all the way through. Okay. Put yours where it needs to go. Can you see? I think that's right. I'm gonna hook it and double check. Yeah. That's right on the money. Okay. So here's the last thing that we're gonna do cause the drone's gonna land itself is I'm just gonna match concrete. I'm gonna go five and six. And what you're gonna do, Kyle. So I have 48 12. Here's what we're gonna do. 48 and three quarter rise 45. Pitch diagonal 68 15 68 15. So from this mark, wherever I crossed that 68 15. Can you mark right there 68 15. And then from that mark, we're gonna come back this same number, which was what? On my calculator, 48 and three quarters. From that mark to here. Nope. Yeah. If you burn 48 and three quarters. 48 and three quarters. Yeah. Okay. That can't be right. Yeah, it is. Okay. I see good. Okay. And we'll head over here. I'm gonna go five and three eighths. What do I, if you hold me to the black line. Okay. 71 and three quarters. So I'm gonna go 71 and three quarters rise 45 pitch. Diagonal is one oh one and a half. So I'm gonna give you one oh one and a half and wherever it crosses the black line. One oh one and a half. And now from that line, we're gonna come back 71 and three quarters. 71 12 and we'll snap that. And that'll be it. Okay. So we're snapped. Okay. Let's do this for like the 99th take. What you would think. Okay. So I've got a picture from the drone of our foundation, this exact situation. Right. I'm in sketch up. Let's just see if we can make this work. So here's the principle at the top left where the cursor is at. We set the laser up to the outside corner. We set the detector on the opposite outside corner even though my line's not that great. Now we have a perfectly straight line across the back. Then we take the detector and we can come to each of these points and then connect the dots. So let's do that. This isn't gonna be real pretty, but I connect the dot and then I can plum down the detector at the corner, plum down, same thing all the way down. One more, come on, one more click. Okay. So not the greatest line, but you get the point. So our top left is a 90 degree corner. Then all we do is we take the laser and we switch it with the detector on the back. Now, let me undo those lines. Now we're gonna set the laser in the top right, the detector in the top left. Once that's aligned, now we can mark each of our step downs, connect the dots, et cetera. And I think that part is makes, you know, should have been pretty clear in the video, I hope. If it didn't, that's 100% my fault. Now we have the two front to back or east, west, let's see, north, south walls are 90 degrees or square to our back wall. Now what we can do is we can take the laser again and the reason that we can do this is because that laser is so accurate is now I can come over here to what will be the garage, set it on the edge. This time I had to go in five and three eighths, just the way that the laser sits on the wall. Kyle had the detector here in the top left and the back. And so now we're just gonna use that side, which is square to the back as a reference point. And then what we're doing is we're shooting across the front and we're marking here and we're marking here. Now it's just a matter of taking that line, so to speak. Hopefully I can do this. And we're just moving parallel. And let's do it again. I think it's control, right? Yeah. So see how that works? Because now our front wall has a bunch of reference lines, we can just go parallel. And then I'm gonna undo that because there's one more is once this line is here, we can get this point here, measure off of the control line here and just string all the way through, reversing back to there. So now we're just parallel, parallel, parallel. Now I cheated in the video, I used a square to draw that corner in square. And then we came here and we knew this number. And so with the calculator, we can calculate 90 degrees come over. And since it's a right triangle, we just measure back. Of course it was square in the video. Okay. And then same thing here. We knew what that front to back parallel was with the calculator, we can just enter this leg is the rise, 45 is the pitch. It gives us this wherever it crosses, then from there we go back and then we're square. I hope that that helps. Thank you everybody for following these videos. I'm trying to become a better teacher. And I just really appreciate you watching the videos, hopefully in 20 years from now when I'm like 65, I'll be really good at this. Okay. All right, we'll see you in the next video everybody.

"{\"text\": \"Alright everybody, let's go back to basics. We need to install some blocking over this exterior wall because the Roseburg IJoyce cantilever passed that wall. These are 2-in-5-16s Roseburg IJoyce with LVL top and bottom flanges, very uniform. So Pro Tip number 1, cut your blocking 1-16th of an inch short. The more square those blocks are cut, the more likely you are to stay on layout. Second, don't nail your IJoyce on layout until the block is in place. The reason for that is the blocks installed more quickly. Ok so once the block is in place, then push that IJoyce tight to the block, nail the bottom flange. Then put another nail into the bottom flange but on the opposite or on the block side. So 2 nails total on opposite sides. I like to toenail the top of the block to keep a nice straight line. We're going to fasten our subfloor to these blocks 6 inches on center. That's going to help to transfer those floor diaphragm loads down through the blocking and IJoyce into the shear walls below and ultimately through the foundation and out as they say.

"{\n    \"text\": \" I know some of you are going to say, hey look at that guy, he's so slow. But the reality is, slow is smooth to move fast. So if I'm slow, that's because I'm being so smooth. And being so smooth just means you're going for that. So don't even think about it. I mean nobody wants to look like those spasmodic framers you've seen on Instagram that look like they're being chased by a swarm of bees. If we're going to use a good quality subfloor, then let's install it properly. So that means that we need to fasten it within about 20 minutes of installing the glue. We want to use a high quality nail like the tetragrip nail. By the way, pre-stage your nails because it makes the reload fast. We can't pull these nails. The heads just pop off. Then if we're going to use a good quality nail, then let's go slow enough, properly fasten the panel. That means six inches on the edges and 12 inches in the field.

"\n{\n  \"text\": \" Make sure is my hard hat crooked We're rolling All right, everybody welcome back to the channel this video is going to cover my top five favorite PPE items personal protective equipment The after all these years these are the five things that I highly recommend and I wear either every day or If I'm on the roof every day, then this is what I'm gonna wear. So let's get into it All right, so item numeral uno is hard hat. I don't personally know anybody likes to wear hard hats I think you just get used to wearing hard hats I have spent good money on carbon fiber hard hats tried all kinds of usually for me hard hats They kind of irritate my neck the carbon fiber didn't because it was lightweight, but this wave cell hard hat I have to say what have we had it now for like two and a half three months probably three months It's vented And it is insanely comfortable I mean it looks fantastic you might remember me for my old job on the Death Star we manned the laser so Hashtag bring back Alderaan basically what makes this hard hat special is this pattern I'm gonna link to it because it's a whole lot more technical than I can go over But snowboard hard hats are made with the same material bike helmets now are made with the same material It's a little bit lower profile and events, but basically It's just comfortable You want to wear a hard hat? We don't have to wear them full-time Only if there's an overhead hazard and the thing about hard hats is they're not going to protect you from some major major like a ton of bricks Falls on your head But it's the bumps the hard bumps that your brain gets where your brain actually will Rotate inside of your skull and we can avoid traumatic brain injury So when we have to wear hard hats, I highly recommend this link in the description. It is not inexpensive But it's super comfortable we're framing inside walls There was no reason to wear them, but we were wearing them and no complaints. So that was item number one Okay, so now we're up to item number two. This is a personal pet peeve of mine Eye protection These are high-spec safety glasses This is probably going to be a special awesome framers edition color and at 45 I finally went with prescription Really does make a difference When peter first reached out to me it was just to be a beta tester and to provide feedback And I fell in love with these. So these are what we wear on site and I highly recommend they're inexpensive There is no reason not to wear safety glasses side shields When I first started in construction it was emphasized to me to wear safety safety glasses Because the little plastic pieces that come off of the nails The collation on the nails the guy that taught me to frame across the floor got a piece in his eye and it cut his cornea And that wasn't even from him using the tool and it actually went behind his safety glasses So side shields what I really like about these is that they don't come back here They stop here. So I don't get all pinched by the end of the day I have a number three. This is also a pet peeve of mine wear hearing protection For years I started in my early 20s wearing foam uh earplugs And then three years ago went to these isotunes. These are the isotunes free. They're bluetooth connected to my phone or music Actually, as I was just talking I got alerted that I have a text or an email I can make phone calls. I can listen to music and these do have an actual noise reduction rating So they're OSHA compliant Not all earbuds check your apple. Uh, what are they called? Earpods the apple earpods try to find the noise reduction rating. I bet you can't I'm sure they help someone but anyway protect your hearing. There is no reason not to do that. I mean come on Don't be dumb Can I still say that? Okay The pita gallery says yes Okay, that that's the easy stuff for personal protective equipment. The um number four is safety toe I didn't wear safety toe for years. I didn't like the cold metal in the winter your feet would get kind of cold depending But the carbon safety toes Overall just wear a safety toe. You kind of get used to kicking things around I wear keen utility because for my wide flat feet They work great a little clownish, right? That is a safety toe I don't think there's much more to say about that And item number five Personal fall arrest gear. We're going to spend some time on this and I'm going to go through this whole setup that we're wearing First Let me uh put on my high spec safety glasses Okay, so let's briefly talk about fall protection. First of all I thought we were so cool that we didn't need fall protection when we're up high. I'm king of the world That was an office reference. That's true. We are so cool Here's the thing it has nothing to do the requirements for fall protection have nothing to do With the slope of the roof. I'm on a 512 right now. We can run around on this all day. We're really not going to fall Until we do I've never fallen off a roof I Nobody here one person way back in 2001 slipped on some dust Thankfully it was a very short fall on that particular section of house, but It doesn't matter what the slope is it matters your exposure to fall or the height And I'm not going to get into what those rules are because they vary state by state country by country So when we went all in on fall arrest harnesses, this is the super anchor deluxe 3d It's got a belt that I attached pouches to so it's kind of like a weight belt big velcro belt Okay, so there's a couple things about this I want to go over one we went high vis because it shows up great on content on the internet They call it the deluxe 3d because there's some other buckles here that you can use in fall restraint It's just comfortable. I will say I had it custom made raising this strap one inch Because I get nipple chafing Kind of like Andy Bernard Seriously, it could be very painful. Here's the components of our fall arrest is spend the money on a harness That's comfortable if you're going to be in it for hours at a time. It needs to be comfortable the rounded edges don't chafe So that's a lot easier then my Share inspection is monday the 15th. I just got to see through my through my garment watch, but I was alerted through my My isotunes free 2.0 Check the link in the description for the coupon code Okay, so I'm attached to a vertical lifeline. This is the deluxe lifeline from super anchor safety It's got a prusik knot. I'll show you how that works here in just a moment By carabiner attached to my shock absorber shock absorber is wrapped through my dorsal d-ring So there's no metal parts back there except for the ring itself and then at the ridge. I'll show the snap hook So what you'll notice right back here is the way that it feeds through the d-ring is it's the loop on the shock absorber And that way there's no metal hook that's bouncing between your shoulder blades It's just tied like a necktie. So not only do you save weight? But you've got nothing bouncing between your shoulder blades just annoying Or getting annoying same thing here. This is my shock absorber if I was to fall in arrest This would break open and it would slow my fall And then I'm connected with a metal carabiner again All of these are super anchor components So they're all designed to work together I'm not going to take it apart because then people would get mad that I'm no longer protected But it's a locking carabiner very lightweight high strength. So there's hardly any weight to this. This is plastic Impact resistant. So I don't have to treat it too nicely Then this is attached by prusik knot. You can see I'm putting tension on it And I got nowhere to go. But if I want to come I take the tension off on the uphill slide And now same thing Basically, it's friction and if I want to go uphill put my hand on the downhill side and I just push So as I walk up That's all there is to it and if I walk down My hand on the uphill side And as soon as I stop You can see how that works So again very lightweight The big advantage of these is that I have no metal parts that get all gummed up And I my goal is to stay in fall restraint as much as possible Which means I can't go over the edge Fall arrest you have to limit your fall because you're still going to get injured pretty good Fall protection is super annoying. Let's all be honest, but you get used to it You just get used to moving it around your feet And as I go uphill The last thing is just part of the system We wrap these around the ridge the black is chafe guard It's sad to say we had an inspection by safety. They had just investigated. Is it accident the week before? Where somebody did not have the chafe guard and this was wrapped around concrete the person fell the edge on that concrete Just sheared the strap that person died All safety rules are written in blood So you think about that we get safety rules after somebody has lost their life or suffered pretty serious harm So you really can't oversell it We just want to pick choices that are super comfortable Okay, so we've got a harness that's comfortable We're all connected up. We've bought all the components none of which are cheap But then again our life is is worth quite a bit We have to have an anchor point that is rated to take fall protection loads For us because we hand cut our roof we can sling these around the ridge And then our snap hook will click into that I'll show that in just a minute Again very simple You just wrap it around the ridge through the loop And then snap hook to this and here's how that works So it's wrapped around the ridge and then snap hook and it's a locking snap hook so you can see you can't just You have to engage it Okay Okay, um, then we'll do b-roll. Let me just add one thing I want to mention Okay, there's one thing I do want to mention about fall protection And it's the excuses that we all make for not using it Harnesses aren't that fun. We like to bring our hoses for our nailers from the eaves our ropes from the top That helps but you also have to get used to walking a certain direction on the roof every time you twist Every all of this stuff ends up, you know, if I'm working and then I'm working You know after a while I end up with knots, you know, it just becomes a tangled mess You've probably heard people and maybe you've said well that more people get injured tripping on a rope That's that's a lie. There are no statistics that show that and if you can find them, please show me That's an excuse that I used to make too like well, I I'm going to trip over this We don't trip over this and here's how I can prove that for years. We had an extension cord per-framer And a nailer per-framer. So if we had four framers That's four extension cords four hoses And guess how often we tripped We learned to step around that stuff. Don't make excuses. Also, there's the first man up rule So do some research into competent person The fact of the matter is is somebody's got to come up first and clip into this That just becomes part of your written fall protection plan If you're really smart You sling it you put your rope on before the roof is even sheathed and you throw the rope now you have access and nobody there was no first man up That's the other thing we like about these is from a ladder. We can actually set the anchors And if we're if we're on it then we can throw the rope But do the research on that make sure you just Let's just stop making excuses I know I sound like that cantanker's old guy because I am that cantanker's old guy Been enough through enough safety training now. I've resisted it for way too many years Just get used to it and like I said earlier in the video It really comes down to picking products that are comfortable to use And then we can just use it and forget about it our eyes are protected our hearing is protected Our toes are protected And our life is protected just because we don't hit the ground doesn't mean we're not going to have some other injuries So you got to use fall protection intelligently Now if you could do me one Giganto favor Please comment below with what your recommendations are or your favorite items for pter Because i'm sure i've missed something Lord knows The more comfortable it is the more likely we are to bear Please hit that like and subscribe button leave a comment.

"\n{\n    \"text\": \" Juri Gayh Have you ever noticed that your rim is taller than your eye-joiced? See that? It's about an eighth of an inch. Do you know the reason for that? The reason is so that the rim takes the gravity loads from above, not the joist. Eye joists are great, right? They're lightweight. It's a great use of materials, but this web can literally tear and shear. And I'll show later, we have some racks that we make out of scrap eye joists. When we overload those, literally the webbing starts to deform and tear. Okay, this one does not show it as well as I thought it would. But even better, these do. Three-quarter inch advantage, we've got two units that are sitting on top of these. They are brazed. But see, that's what we're talking about. The eye-joist is not designed to take the heavy loads. That's why we use squash blocks or the structural rim that is a little taller than the joist. So notice how that's to be getting to buckle. We've actually had these where they tear like paper, where they don't just like completely tear, but you can see that it starts and that's called shear. It's a limitation, but not a big one. Not a big deal at least. So here's how that works. Over there, that's a hand cut roof. So from the halfway point, that exterior wall is carrying half of the roof load and that gravity load has been transferred all the way down to the foundation. It does that through headers and through our rim. This is inch and a half Roseburg rigid rim. It's LVL. Sometimes we even have to reinforce with squash blocks. And when we do that, those squash blocks also need to be slightly taller. And that way the load from above comes through the blocks, not through the joist. We want the joist to carry the floor loads, but our gravity loads from above, we want transferred through to the walls below. Now be honest, how many of you, by a show of invisible hands, would hold your floor joist up to the top of the rim because we're framers. It's supposed to be flush, right? I can honestly say that it was only two or three years ago that I read what I had posted earlier in the video that nope, it is deliberately a little bit tall. And that's why you never stop learning. Okay, a couple of things to go over on this floor system. One doesn't it just look nice and clean? You notice there's quite a few rows of blocking. Why? Two reasons in this case. One reason is we need our eye joist to stay vertical in order to carry their loads. And so sometimes we block in between those over walls to keep them that way. The other reason is that the blocking nailed to the wall below and the floor sheathing nailed to the blocking from above. That helps the floor diaphragm to transfer through the shear walls, kind of like what you're seeing on that side of the stairway, the left hand side. Once that floor sheathing nails to that LVL, that LVL of course is fastened to a shear wall. That provides lateral restraint in the case of an earthquake. And we have quite a few shear walls down there on that one. You notice right there, for example, next to the stairs, well, first of all, the stairway wall sheathed. That wall on the bottom right is sheathed. It's a shear wall. So it's bolted to the concrete. And of course, the blocking is nailed. Floor diaphragm nailed to the blocks. In my mind, the way I think of this is we're taking a bunch of disparate components and we're just joining them to make them act like one. I know it's an overly simplified way of viewing it. There we have blocking on the bottom right again, a bedroom wall. And then right there, Joyce lands right on top of a sheathed wall. There's actually going to be a wall on top of that goes all the way up to the roof. So the roof sheathing is connected to a wall that's connected to the floor, which is connected to, you know, and you get the point all the way down. I don't know if you can tell. I kind of nerd out on this stuff. I have been reading the product info for many years, always learning something new. Wood products, boy, there's a lot of advantages to them. Incidentally, that LVL on the left, we will put a four by six under it. That just allowed us to locate it when we did layout. Anyway, thank you so much for watching, everybody.

It just loops the ridge. It has a chafe guard. Inexpensive, easy to install, easy to uninstall, and reusable. So what I like to do is I set all my sheets and tack them.

But you'll notice that my rope comes from above. My hose comes from below. I always run the hose at the eaves. Then also notice that I am not adjusting the rope grab at all.

Now, the very top piece, I'm going to fold it, pull the tape off, set it down there. I'm using a little blue quick flash tool.

Anyway, no, not the Bloody Marriots and we're growing. I've been drinking their, oh shoot, Omega, Synthring or other hazy IPA. Pretty awesome. They're double right now. Sun River Brewing always has the best double IPAs. It's a little warm. So I think tomorrow while they go paddling down the river, probably just going to feel time there. Yeah, I'm just getting really broadcast where this place is. We've been coming to Sun River since I was born, so 45 years, 46 years, something like that. What an amazing place. I mean, look at this. It's just us. Dave, how's it going, man? I thought I would just practice. I mean, yeah, like 30-something miles of paved paths. And this bike does not take that much to pedal. So I'm quite happy about that. Check those ways. I'm going to pass you. It was rhetorical. All right, people are rapidly dropping. You want to go right and then go past the lodge? She's not an e-bike, folks. She's not an e-bike. Well, 12 miles hiking. Yeah, I'm feeling it in my legs. I'm feeling it more in my hips. My legs are actually feeling pretty good. So I've got to get active while we've got summer. Before the sheer and utter depression of winter sets in. But right now, those guys, I mean, almost completely clear. There's the moon. I'll flip you around. Figure out the button. Here's my turn. Here we go. So that's a runway right here. Looks like there's a pretty good sized jet down there. Oh, are you going to pass me? There's the moon. Oh, there she goes. Pedal assist five, people. So a family tradition for us is to go for a sunset bike ride as often as we can over down here. I mean, since we were little kids, it was like, let's do the river run. Ended up at goodies. Earn our ice cream, right? That gas was expensive. I think this ice cream is going to be even more. Look at them. The ladies always nod or wave. And the dudes don't. So here's the airport. That is a pretty good sized jet. I think I can pinch the zoom. Hey, running out of breath. Yeah, there it is. Can I zoom? I can't. A few of the houses here actually have airplane hangers. But I mean, those are from the 70s. Yep. We toured one years ago. Pretty interesting seeing the airplane hanger slash garage. You know what it's like, little testness. Bike riding and talking. And it looks like some helicopters parked there. I wonder if that's for the wildfires. Yeah, all the snow parks here. That's where all the forest service, all the firefighters stage. We passed one of the bachelors today because there's just a fire not very far from here on Cascade Lakes. Oh, nice. Nice hand signaling. Okay, stay with me people. We're going up to the lodge here in just a minute. Also, man, I am sweaty. Why am I wearing a flannel? So there's the lodge. Very like South Africa's Sabari. What a cool building. I'll have to do some stories a little bit later in the week. I think it was built in the early 70s. I don't remember. And yes, I'm still riding no hands. I'm pretty proud of myself. There we go. That cool. A bunch of exposed wood beams inside. Hello, man. Okay, we're almost there. We're almost there. All 21 of you. We're almost there. We started at 165. What a good day. What a good, good day. I was going to go right. Just for the sake of the footage. See, now I will ride with one hand. Because you want to hit this break, not that break. Unless you want to go over head first. Which would make for some epic live footage. Not bad. Yeah, it's like a ghost town. Like literally, where is everybody? Sweet, sweet, sweet shadow. Okay. Oops. Wrong button. Okay, I'm signing off. I'm going to need two hands for this.

"{\n    \"text\": \" So this is a six inch fully threaded screw. It is stronger than a Simpson strong-tie H1. However when you use these you want to use the guides here and here and you've got bubble levels because you want to angle it this way and if you were looking at it from the side you want to angle it back so you really want the screw not necessarily to go straight up although that's allowed but at a slight angle and that way you get the fully developed load ratings. I think it's pretty obvious right off the bat that we have a significantly faster installation and because I'm walking on the floor it's significantly safer. In fact with that quick stick I have installed these six inch screws at an 11 foot ceiling height so that means the vast majority of hurricane ties that we need to attach we can now do it much more quickly and safely and remember in the hierarchy of controls when it comes to safety if we can eliminate the hazard that is always our safest bet.\",\n    \"description\": \"@Strongtie Quik Stik and SDWC high strength screw drasically speeds up rafter/truss tie install time.

"{\"text\": \" Oh, and I said I would show you another trick of my sleeve. It's not really a trick. I have, those are called dobeys. They're extremely cheap. They're three inches, you can buy them in different sizes. I buy them in three inches because I need to keep my rebar three inches up off of the dirt. Remember that concrete is very strong in compression, but it is very weak in tension. We make up for that with steel reinforcement. So we say rebar, but really what we're providing here is reinforcement. That reinforcement needs to be toward the bottom. That's why we're using three inch dobeys. Our engineer wants three inches of concrete under the steel. So that steel is placed in the tension side of the concrete. The dobeys just makes it easy to keep it nice and consistent. You could see there in real time, I'm just tying it by hand. You could use one of those little rebar tying tools like the little hook. It might go faster, I don't know. I mean, look how fast I am right there. I just prefer to run around with no tools. I just twist it with my hands and we're good to go.\", \"description\": \"I use 3\\\" dobies to hold reinforcement off the ground.
